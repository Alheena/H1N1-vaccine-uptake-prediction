Vaccination is a key public health measure to fight infectious diseases. They provide immunization and help to prevent further spread of the disease. Vaccines for H1N1 were first publicly available in the United States in October 2009, when the United States government began a nation-wide vaccination campaign. Understanding the impact of socioeconomic background, behavior and health-related opinions on vaccination patterns can prove to be useful for future public health efforts.When the United States government began a vaccination campaign and people took vaccination based on certain factors. So, to find out the vaccination status National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) was conducted. In this paper, we use the data from the above survey to develop a model that predicts how likely people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine.
